# **CentralBank-LLM (ChatGPT, Langchain)** 
**[ü•àPlotly-Langchain Challenge Winner](https://medium.com/plotly/dash-club-13-langchain-plotly-upcoming-webinar-dash-online-course-dash-langchain-challenge-6820b39caa08#7aac) | [View Webinar Recording](https://youtu.be/sVHfc27BlSE?si=RoZlsLK89HFhvWMw&t=2145)**<br>
Discover what top banking institutions <ins>**really think</ins>** about macroeconomic conditions (inflation, interest rates, GDP, unemployment, oil prices). Plotly Dash App is built to extract main highlights and query latest central banking publications from:
- [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy.htm)
- [Bank of England](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy-report/monetary-policy-report)
- [European Central Bank](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/economic-bulletin/html/index.en.html)

The RAG-LLM retriever is trained to answer user prompts and generate plots **<ins>exclusively using textual data downloaded directly from central banks<ins>**. 
It also provides citations to the original publications (source, author, and page information).

5. open the app at http://localhost:8050/


## **Notes & Known Issues:**
### Langchain Chroma vectorstore deletion
ChromaDB is known to have issues in Streamlit/Dash apps when trying to delete collections or reset the database (if ChromaDB was used in a running callback). This behaviour results in new embeddings being appended to old db. Every Vectordb instance including as.retriever() needs to be set to None i.e. connection to Chroma terminated for the files to be released for deletion, once vectordb instance is set to None there is no way to reinitiate the database connection. This was somewhat addressed in old `delete_downloads()` function:
```python
    if os.path.exists(persist_directory):
        shutil.rmtree(persist_directory, ignore_errors=True)
```
However, *chroma.sqlite3* file will still exist and requires a Dash app restart to terminate the callback and release the file for deletion (or it can be deleted manually).
The `langchain.vectorstores` module does not include functionality to perform `client.reset()` or track the collection, therefore I suggest using the `chromadb` library directly for similar projects. Those are the main reasons why webscraping, text splitting and embedding should be done using FastAPI backend server in MongoDB or Pinecone, and not locally.
### 400 Bad Request:
Frequent requests to Bank of England server will sometimes return less files than actually available due to cooldown. This can be remediated by changing IP Address or modifying the for-loop to request only reports from February, May, August, November (at expense of poentially missing emergency publications).
